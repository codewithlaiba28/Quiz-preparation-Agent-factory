### **1. Central Idea: General Agent**

* The **General Agent** is at the core of the system.
* It acts as a **universal problem-solver**, capable of performing multiple tasks by generating code or instructions.
* It uses **Python (OpenAI/Claude SDK)** or **SKILL.md (instructions)** as its medium to interact with different domains.
* Essentially, the General Agent converts natural language tasks into executable code or structured instructions.

### **2. Universal Interface (Code)**

* The **Universal Interface** is represented as a hub connecting the General Agent to various business domains.
* Code here acts as the **universal language** that allows the agent to interact with different systems.
* All instructions from the General Agent are translated into this interface for execution.

### **3. Domain-Specific Applications**

The image shows multiple business and analytical areas where the General Agent can operate:

1. **Data Analytics** – performing tasks like data extraction, visualization, and statistical analysis.
2. **Document Processing** – reading, summarizing, or processing documents automatically.
3. **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** – managing customer data, automating follow-ups, and communication.
4. **Finance** – handling payments, invoices, or financial calculations.
5. **Supply Chain** – logistics, inventory, and operations automation.
6. **HR (Human Resources)** – managing recruitment, employee data, or HR workflows.

### **4. Mechanism**

* The General Agent receives a task.
* It processes the request through **Claude/OpenAI SDK or SKILL.md instructions**.
* The task is converted into executable instructions via the **Universal Interface (code)**.
* Then the agent executes these instructions across relevant domains, like Finance, HR, or Supply Chain.

### **5. Key Insight from the Book**

* **Code as the universal interface** is the core principle.
* The General Agent doesn’t just generate text; it **performs actions** by leveraging code.
* This enables **scalable, autonomous, and domain-agnostic AI** that can handle multiple workflows.

In short, the image visualizes how a single **General Agent** can act as a **digital FTE**, automating tasks across various business domains by using **code as the universal interface**, either through **Python SDKs** or **instruction files (SKILL.md)**.
