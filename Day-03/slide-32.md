## What this image represents (according to the Agent-Native book)

The image shows **“How we used to think about agents”**, which the book explains as the **old, role-based mindset**.

### Old thinking: *One Agent = One Job*

In the image, you see four separate agents:

* **Coding Agent**
* **Research Agent**
* **Finance Agent**
* **Marketing Agent**

Each agent:

* Is tightly **bound to a single domain**
* Has **hard-coded skills**
* Works in a **closed loop** with limited tools
* Cannot easily adapt outside its role

This reflects a **tool-era mindset**, not an agent-native one.

---

## Why this thinking is limited (as per the book)

According to the *Agent-Native* philosophy:

1. **Agents are not job titles**

   * “Coding Agent” or “Marketing Agent” is just a *label*, not intelligence.
   * Real intelligence comes from **reasoning + tools + context**, not predefined roles.

2. **Skills were siloed**

   * Each agent had its own logic and tools.
   * No shared memory, no dynamic skill creation.

3. **No true autonomy**

   * Agents reacted to prompts.
   * They did not *plan*, *decompose*, or *self-improve*.

4. **Poor scalability**

   * Want a new capability?
     → Build a new agent.
   * This does not scale in real systems.

## What the book argues instead (the shift)

The *Agent-Native* book proposes a **new mental model**:

> **Agents are general reasoning engines, not fixed workers.**

Instead of:

```
Coding Agent
Research Agent
Finance Agent
```

We move to:

```
One General Agent
→ dynamically loads skills
→ uses tools
→ adapts to context
→ executes workflows
```

## Key idea the image is preparing you for

This image exists to show **what we are moving away from**.

The book then introduces:

* **General Agents**
* **Skills as code**
* **Tools as capabilities**
* **Context as memory**
* **Plans instead of prompts**

So instead of building *many agents*, we build:

> **One powerful agent that can become any agent.**

## One-line summary (Agent-Native perspective)

> The image represents the outdated belief that agents must be role-specific, while the Agent-Native model replaces this with a single, general, skill-driven, autonomous agent.
